# KayaSnowman

Kaya Snowman is a Python project that generates ASCII art snowmen with customizable heights. The project includes two different snowman drawing styles: a box-style snowman with a detailed face (`kaya.py`) and a traditional rounded snowman design (`snowman.py`). Both implementations allow you to specify the snowman's height in feet and inches, dynamically adjusting the body proportions to match your desired dimensions. Whether you want a classic winter character or a more geometric design, Kaya Snowman brings the joy of building snowmen to your terminal!

Real Kaya is a bum.
